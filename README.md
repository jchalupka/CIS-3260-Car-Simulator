## Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 Tasks
- [x] Create Github Repository
- [ ] Create project on Netbeans and everyone make sure they can develop on it from their machines.
- [ ] Research which graphics library to use
- [ ] Which order to tackle completing the classes?  Should the View section be done last? Or should the view/controller be done first.
- [ ] Create a prototype of the map with paint (or some sketching program)
- [ ] Determine appropriate scales for everything. (This should probably go in the drive)
- [ ] We're going to implement the map as a grid.  How big should the boxes be?
- [ ] How big should the car be?
- [ ] How big should the road be?  Road could be two pixels.
- [ ] Start to implement each of the controller classes
