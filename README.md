# Car Simulator

Group project for CIS*3260 Software Design IV.

## Contribution Instructions
1. Create a new branch
2. Commit changes to that branch (try to branches specific to minimize merge conflicts)
3. Write any necessary tests for the changes that you have made.
4. Run the test suite against your branch.
5. If all the tests pass merge with master.

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 Tasks
- [x] Create Github Repository
- [x] Create project on Netbeans and everyone make sure they can develop on it from their machines.
- [x] Research which graphics library to use
- [ ] Which order to tackle completing the classes?  Should the View section be done last? Or should the view/controller be done first.
- [x] Create a prototype of the map with paint (or some sketching program)
- [ ] Determine appropriate scales for everything. (This should probably go in the drive)
- [ ] We're going to implement the map as a grid.  How big should the boxes be?
- [ ] How big should the car be?
- [ ] How big should the road be?  Road could be two pixels.
- [x] Start to implement each of the controller classes

#### Status of each class
Mark the status with [NOT_STARTED :apple:, IN_PROGRESS :lemon:, COMPLETED :green_apple:]
Also note that completed just means the basic funcionality is completed, and IN_PROGRESS means there is an open branch currently working on this functionality.
